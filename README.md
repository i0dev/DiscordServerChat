# Discord Server Chat Bot/Plugin,
Sends the chat from in game to discord!

## How it works,
First you must make a discord bot, and then in the config.yml file the plugin generated, you enter the Bot's Token, and any other information that you need to change! Every time someone types in chat, it sends the message in a discord channel of your choice!
