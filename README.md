# Discord Server Chat Bot/Plugin!
This bot/plugin Sends the chat from in game to discord! This is a PLUGIN, and it goes into your plugins folder on your server. It will not work if its anywhere else!

## How it works,
First you must make a discord bot, and then in the config.yml file the plugin generated, you enter the Bot's Token, and any other information that you need to change! Every time someone types in chat, it sends the message in a discord channel of your choice!

### Permissions,
 - ```dsc.*```        - ``Gives permissions to run any command.``
 - ```dsc.reload.```  - ``Gives permissions to use /dsc reload.``
